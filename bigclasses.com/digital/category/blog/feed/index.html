								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to SEO, Google will always encourage its users to apply legal ways to design their websites. It needs a White-Hat SEO where the website can be optimized in the title and meta description with the important keywords. And most importantly, these keywords need to be on the website in a uniform manner. But in the world of competition, not everyone is using White-Hat SEO.</p>
<div class="blog-img"><img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/black-hat-seo-techniques.png" alt="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/black-hat-seo-techniques.png-Bigclasses"></div>
<p>Black-Hat SEO is technique, where the website is ranked using ways that Google disapproves. People are using this technique to outsmart the Google, and rank their website on the top. The main thing about the Black-Hat SEO is that it will rank your website on the top, and you will get great traffic. But there is a side effect of this approach. If the Google finds on your website, it will rank it at the low level. It can be listed on the 2 or more pages, and people who are searching for the keyword/keywords will not be able to find your website URL. If you’d like to know how to use the Black-Hat SEO techniques, you can go ahead and read the following.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">

</div>
<h3><strong>Using Paid Links</strong></h3>
<p>There are companies who are spending their money in buying links, instead of creating backlinks organically. These are the links that the company buys to make their SEO even more powerful. The problem is that the content used in these links lacks quality. Also, you can use anchor links which make a strong game for website ranking. These two reasons can manipulate the search engine ranking, and that is why the SEO technique is classified as a serious technique.</p>
<h3>Using Spam Comments</h3>
<p>We all know that reviews are one of the important factors used to make an effective impression on any product or service. But yes, the comments are not always true and not from different individuals. There are few comments on some websites completely unrelated to the product and services of the company.</p>
<p>Spam comments create free backlinks. They’re a non-follow, and it’s useless to the SEO, but again, it is one of the popular practices. Creating these spam comments is easy, and can be done with some online tools. These unrelated comments can leave a negative impression on the readers.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">

</div>
<h3>Using Duplicate Content</h3>
<p>Duplicate content is the copied and pasted content on the websites. They aren’t unique at all and has plagiarized one. Google prefers unique contents on the websites and refuses to accept the copied content. The copied content will affect your domain/domains. But if you are trying to put some copied contents, make sure you add a canonical tag, or else it will be indexed, and hence affect your website.</p>
<div class="blog-img"><img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/seo-techniques-e1523000748758.png" alt="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/black-hat-seo-techniques.png-Bigclasses"></div>
<h3>Using Article Spinners</h3>
<p>This is a popular Black Hat SEO technique where the contents are selected and are spun using article spinners. This is like plagiarism to the next level where the content is spun to clear new and unique posts. The problem is when the content is spun, the sentences make no sense most of the time.</p>
<h3>Using   Doorway Pages</h3>
<p>Doorway pages are also called jump pages, gateway pages and etc. These are specialized to optimize the targeted keywords to rank the pages. These are the landing pages that have less value and is only created to trick the search engines to transfer the visitor from the chosen URL to another URL (their website).</p>
<h3>Keyword Stuffing</h3>
<p>Keyword stuffing is a well-known technique by content writers and digital marketers. It is a method where the keywords are stuffed into the contents, in order to rank the website on the search engines. The keyword density isn’t maintained, and hence it is always high.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training">To Attend Demo Click Here!</a>
</div>
<p>Also, there are some websites, where they keep the content in a simple manner, but they increase the keywords by other means. They will add the keywords here and there but will be invisible. These will be of the same color as the background color, and therefore, it won’t be easy to find by the Google. But this website can go down if a visitor reports this technique to the Google by submitting the screenshot, and URL to the Google.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, we all know that SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the optimization of the website with the help of keywords so that it can be easily found on the search engines. Keywords are the main ingredient of the SEO. You can use them on On-Page and Off-Page SEO. But when it comes to the SEO techniques, the Google can a little tricky to impress.</p>
<div class="blog-img"><img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/white-hat-seo-black-hat-seo.jpg" alt="White-Hat SEO and Black-Hat SEO-Bigclasses" /></div>
<p>Google loves authentic content and also, websites that follow its rules and regulation. When it comes to what Google loves, it loves the White-Hat SEO. The Black-Hat SEO is the White-Hat SEO’s opponent and isn’t encouraged by the Google to be used on the websites. So, let’s further get a deep knowledge of the White-Hat and Black-Hat SEO.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training">To Know More Click Here!</a>
</div>
<h3>White-Hat SEO</h3>
<p>The White-Hat SEO is an approved SEO method by the Google. This method is used on the websites to optimize it with the set of keywords in the content while maintaining a perfect keyword density. White-Hat SEO focuses on creating their content for the users, and not for the websites. The White-Hat SEO is encouraged by the Google. It matches the Google’s guideline. It is optimized for easier readability by the humans. The contents are encouraged to be perfect and simple so that it can share across any platforms.</p>
<div class="blog-img"><img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/white-hat-seo-2.jpg" alt="White-Hat SEO-Bigclasses" /></div>
<p>The website will be White-Hat SEO friendly when the content is sensible with the help of keywords. It needs to have a perfect keyword density. Also, the website needs to have good backlinks from authentic websites. The websites need to upload at the fastest rate and also, needs to be mobile friendly. You, also, need to optimize the website, and web pages with title and meta description.</p>
<h3>Black-Hat SEO</h3>
<p>The Black-Hat SEO is the opposite of the White-Hat SEO. It isn’t approved by the Google guidelines and violates it at an extreme level. It has various strategies and techniques that are not accepted by the Google. But it does give you the required results in no time.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training">Learn more From Our Experts</a>
</div>
<p>Black-Hat SEO basically focuses on the ranking, and not on the users. The main aim is to rank the website with the help of keyword stuffing, and keyword hiding. The keywords will be uploaded on the website using the background theme color. The contents can be copied and pasted from various websites. The contents can be rephrased using some online tools, and this is called article spinning. Backlinks are added using some paid tools, that ads too many backlinks to help you raise the rank.</p>
<h3>Which is the better option?</h3>
<p>White-Hat SEO is the best option, and should always be encouraged to do so. If you want your business to run for a long-term, you can opt for White-HAT SEO. And if you want to go for short-term, you can opt for Black-Hat SEO. And on the other hand, the Black-Hat SEO is risky, expensive, and needs deep technical knowledge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Panda is a Google update that has changed the face of the search results. It was released in 2011. The reason behind this is to analyze the websites deeply and catch the low-quality sites. Google Panda will take the high-quality website, and rank them on its first page. And it will keep the low-quality website on the second, third and further pages.</p>
<p>When Google Panda was implemented by the Google, websites with too many advertisements dropped in their rankings. It affected 12% of the search results. The main goal of the Google Panda is to create a long-term trust of the users and at the same time, create a safe ecosystem for the publishers.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/google-panda.png" alt="Google panda-Bigclasses">
</div>
<h3>Google Panda and Website Ranking</h3>
<p>The Google Panda will create a ratio with the website’s ratio links, and search queries. This ratio is then used to create a site-wide modification factor which creates a modification factor for the page based the queries. And if the page fails to meet this, the modification factor will be applied, and hence the website will be ranked a low level.  It affects the entire site rather than a single page or content.</p>
<p>The Google Panda scans larger data set and searches for particular solutions to problems. It eliminates the unnecessary comparisons and computations, and this is how it will reduce the overall calculations to find the best match to the required solution.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training/">To Learn More Click Here!</a></div>
<p>It always separates the websites based on the good or bad quality, and this is done with the help of quality rater survey. It finds the best grouping of signals on your website and weigh the values for the signals, and find a close match with quality raters.</p>
<h3>How to Keep your Website safe from Google Panda?</h3>
<p><strong> Improve your Bad Content</strong></p>
<p>You need to improve the quality of the content in all the pages. They should be relevant and should have all the keywords. Avoid keyword stuffing. And make the content match with the genre of your web page.</p>
<p><strong>Remove your Duplicate Content</strong></p>
<p>Use 301 redirects to direct your outdated URLs. You should only have one version of your homepage. And use a Canonical attribute to pages with the same contents. And analyze your website, and remove all the duplicate contents.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top:20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/google-panda-recovery.jpg" alt="To do Website safe from Google Panda-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p><strong>Clean your Website</strong></p>
<p>Your website needs to be simple, and it shouldn’t be composed of too many ads. You shouldn’t use more than 100 links per page. Use CSS and HTML validator, and validate your website. And lastly, fix the broken links.</p>
<p><strong>Improve the Website’s Speed</strong></p>
<p>You should not have a slow speed website. A website with slow speed can increase your bounce rate. People may not even return back. Therefore, make a responsive web design, and use cache plugins. You need to compress the images and videos. Remove unnecessary WordPress plug-ins and yes, avoid using Flash.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training/">To Attend Demo Click Here!</a></div>
<p><strong>Build Powerful Content</strong></p>
<p>You need to update your website with a new and fresh content. It needs to be authentic, and well edited. And most important, you need to create content for the readers and not the Google.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Penguin is a Google algorithm that was launched in April 2012.

It will decrease the search engine ranking of any website that will violet Google&#8217;s Webmaster Guidelines.<br />
Google Webmaster has guidelines such as using White-Hat SEO only, creating trusted backlinks, plagiarism free content, and etc. And it specifically checks for Black-Hat SEO.

<div class="blog-img">
<img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/google-penguin.png" alt="Google Penguin-Bigclasses" />
</div>

<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training/">To Learn More Click Here!</a></div>
<p>Websites used negative link building before Google Penguin was implemented by the Google. And when the Google Penguin was implemented, it deeply analyzed the content. It recognized the good and bad content. It also sees if the content is written is less or more. If it is less and is spammy, it will penalize the website. The main goal of this algorithm was to observe the spammy contents. And due to this, many websites that were in the first rank fell at the last rank.The Penguin  3 version affected only 0.3% of the queries, and Penguin 4 affected 2.3% of the queries, and Penguin 5 affected only 1% of the queries.</p>
<p>Google algorithms or updates  such as the Panda and Penguin is being implemented to filter the websites and keep the quality website on the search engines.</p>

<h3>What to Do In Case your Website Ranking Goes Down Due to Google Penguin?</h3>
<p>You need to check the list of backlinks you have. You need to identify which ones are harmful, and then get rid of it. And in the meanwhile, you need to create good backlinks. You can do this by Google’s Disavow Tool.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training/">To Attend Demo Click Here!</a></div>
<p>Building good links can help you get back in the rankings, but it will take time. It will tip the algorithm in your favor with these good links and will recover your website. You, also, need to check your keywords in the contents. Avoid keyword stuffing, as the Google Webmaster will not approve of it. And avoid using SEO automation as it violates Google’s TOS. Lastly, get rid of the Black-Hat SEO. Yes, analyze your website, and get rid of the hidden keywords in your contents.</p>

<p>Google Hummingbird is the Google algorithm announced on September 26, 2013. The name hummingbird was given due to the bird’s speed and accuracy. The Google Hummingbird is designed to look at the website content deeply, i.e., on each web page. It helps in allowing users to get the required content from the web page and not from the home page only. That means, it will be directed to the particular webpage, and it will not be directed to the website’s homepage.</p>
<p>The Google Hummingbird advanced the Google search and gave it a more human touch. It is based on how humans will search on the search engines. It can even read a sentence and give you the exact thing you want to read. And this is also, the main reasons web developers and content writers were asked to make their website and content in a natural manner so that it can navigate effectively.</p>
<div class="blog-img"><img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humming-bird.png" alt="Google Hummingbird-Bigclasses" /></div>
<p>According to the previous Google chief Amit Singhal, the Hummingbird was one of the most dramatic changes of the algorithm since 2001. The reason he said this due to the fact that the previous algorithm gave the results according to each word in the search query, but the Hummingbird considers the not one but a combination of words. The Hummingbird shows the results based on the meaning of words and is not focused on the words itself. Also, it doesn’t take much time to give the results as soon as it is typed or searched. And due this character of speed and accuracy, the name hummingbird was given to the algorithm.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/seo-training">To Learn More Click Here!</a></div>
<p>The Hummingbird is designed based on its ability to act as a human and understand the human language. It will help the users to get the results as they require. It understands the meaning of the keywords when typed in the search engine. It analyzes the page authority and website contents. It uses this in information to help the users get to the specific part of the page on the website, rather than showing its way to the website’s homepage.</p>
<h3>Google Hummingbird and Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>The Hummingbird has encouraged its writers to use a simple content that is easily readable and indexed. Therefore, they are asked to use natural language rather than focusing more on the keywords, and keyword stuffing. The web designers are encouraged to create their website with best effective technical website features as the page linking, On-Page SEO, URL, and HTML tags, high-quality content, and unique content (free from plagiarism).</p>
<div class="blog-img">&lt;imgmargin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;&#8221; src=&#8221;https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/download-e1522764102394.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;Google Hummingbird and Search Engine Optimization&#8221;&gt;</div>
<p>Hummingbird also gives much importance to the long tail keywords. Long tail keywords give a deeper meaning about the search. For example, if you search restaurants, it may show you the definition. But if you search restaurants in New York, it has a deeper meaning and will give you exactly what you want. And Hummingbird also gives importance to the synonyms. This has also been updated in its algorithms. Even if you search with different words, it will give you the same search, but with different websites ranked on different levels.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media marketing is a platform where everyone gets quite excited about its methods. It is all due to its efficiency in attracting the customers and clients. It’s one of the parts of Digital Marketing where this has a powerful influence on people.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-media-marketing-mistakes-e1522760034430.jpg" alt="Mistakes to Avoid in Social Media Marketing-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p>The social media marketing executives are responsible for maintaining their social media in every way possible. And yes, while maintaining, a person can definitely make mistakes. These mistakes can be created even though the marketing through social media is simple and easy. There are a number of platforms such as the Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, We Heart It, Tumbler, and etc. Well maintaining your company’s social media accounts across all these platforms can be challenging, but it is easy if you follow some important rules. Let’s see the top mistakes a marketer can avoid in SMM.</p>
<h3>Not Having a Clear Goal</h3>
<p>If you are a marketer, even before you enter this field, you need to know your goals. You need to understand the company, and its business in detail, and hence, make a goal out of it. What and how can you make your company outshine in the market? Where can you target people? Which is the best way to create engaging posts? There are many questions you need to answer about before you even start. And when you have all the answers, you need to go for it!</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/social-media-marketing-training">To Learn More Click Here!</a></div>
<p>If you don’t have a clear idea, your plans to help the company will have no future to succeed. Do you want to create some engaging posts or videos of your products and services? Do you want to create some campaigns? You need to figure out ways to make your goals.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-media-marketing-mistakes-2-1.jpg" alt="Not Having a Clear Goal in SMM-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p>Let’s say you have started maintaining your social media, and you have posted videos and images with the best taglines. You even got some likes and reviews. How can you measure them? How can you know which post has gotten more likes? How many people have visited your website due to your post? In order to have a clear analytics on this, you need to use Facebook Pixel tracking code and set your site analytics. You definitely need to look at the analytics and make decisions based on it. And being on Facebook itself, you need to use the Facebook Analytics, and understand the marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>Not Configuring Conversion Tracking</h3>
<p>You need to set conversion tracking. Many of the marketers forget to add and check their conversion rates. You need to configure it which will help you understand the ad budget. You need to track the performance of the ads. How can you analyze them? You can analyze them based on the impressions, views, click through rates, and conversion rates. These are important or else, you’ll be confused about what is happening with your ad?</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-conversion.png" alt="Conversion Tracking in Facebook-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p>For your Facebook ad, you can go for Facebook Pixel. You need to add the code to the site. This code will map specific actions that will is taken on the ad. For example, if a person clicks on your ad, visits the URL provided, purchases your product, and etc. All these will be tracked.</p>
<p>How can you use this information to your benefit? Let’s say, you have 50 products, you can know which product is being highly demanded by the audience. You can use this information to focus on those products and create engaging content on it. For example, if you created an ad on Himalaya Orange Peel off Mask, and it has got thousands or millions of views, likes and etc. You can work on blog contents on the product which can attract the customers and make them understand about the product in detail. And hence, you can share them with the social media.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/social-media-marketing-training">Learn More From Our Experts</a></div>
<h3>Not Opting for A/B Testing</h3>
<p>A/B testing is one of the important components of the marketing schemes. Why is important? It is important to know which of your strategy is going well and attracted more customers. For example, if you are working for Lenovo. And you have a new product, say Lenovo 320 S. So, let’s say in test A, you have created a post where a customer can buy this laptop with a free laptop bag worth 5,000 INR, plus with 2 years of warranty in just 50, 000 INR. And in test B, a customer can buy this laptop with a free Hi-design bag, JBL Headset worth 14, 000 INR, plus 1 year of warranty only in just 49, 000 INR. You can post the test A today, and test B after a few months. Now, all you need to observe and analyze which test get more customers. How many customers buy the laptop in test A or B?</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opting.png" alt="Conversion Tracking in Facebook-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p>The A/B testing is important to know the importance of the product you are selling, and how you can attract customers by selling it in different ways.</p>
<h3>Not Opting for Creativity</h3>
<p>The social media marketing is known for its creativity. You need to add some create graphics in the posts or else you can add some great quality videos, and hence make your brand powerful. Your company profile as a profession depends on the hands of creativity. You need to add some great taglines. And you definitely need to add an excellent image with great pixels. If you have a graphic designer, ask him or her to create something eye-catching!</p>
<p>If you want to go for videos, be sure to add something simple to small length videos. A small length video will not only catch the attention of viewers, but also create an impression on them. A long video will automatically bore the viewers, and they may leave or scroll down their timeline. So make sure you create a video of 1 to 5-minute video.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SMM-creativity.jpg" alt="Not Opting for Creativity< in SMM-Bigclasses">
</div>
<p>These are some of the things some of the markers lack and hence, their marketing objectives go to waste. Your main goal as a marketer is to create an impression, influence on the people by various methods.  Create creative posts, add great taglines or one-liners perform an A/B testing, ad a tracking code to the ads, and lastly, use analytics to make better decisions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You must have heard these two terms as a business owner or as a marketer. Inbound marketing and outbound marketing are the form of marketing that is designed to attract customers, increase your website visits, grow the business exponentially. These both may have the same motive but are different from each other. And only one is dominant over the other. Let’s further understand this by getting an overview of outbound and inbound marketing.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/marketing-inboundoutbound.jpg" alt="Difference between inbound&#038;outbound-Bigclasses">
</div>
<h3>Outbound Marketing</h3>
<p>Outbound marketing can be known as the traditional marketing where there is an involvement of advertisement on the TV, radio, print media, mail letters, and etc. These were the first form of marketing in the traditional days where the TVs and the radio ruled the world. People dependent on them and the companies took advantage to put their ads. It did attract thousands of viewers worldwide, and yes, it did sell its products successfully. The best example for this is the Coco-Cola TV advertisements.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/digital-marketing-training/">To Learn More Click Here!</a></div>
<p>The main idea was to increase their brand awareness using these entertainment units. It created a strategy where the people would remember the ad, the company, and be influenced to buy their products. Companies like Coco-Cola, Colgate, Old Spice, Kellogg’s, and many more have successfully raised their brand identity.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outbound-marketing.png" alt="Outbound Marketing">
</div>
<p>Basically, this type of marketing is focused on pushing the audience to buy your products, and it isn’t targeting the right audience. But the problem with this marketing is that it is now an old marketing scheme. People are more involved in the internet through their PC or mobile phones, and that is why internet marketing or the inbound marketing is dominating the outbound marketing. Now, let’s see what is inbound marketing.</p>
<h3>Inbound Marketing</h3>
<p>The inbound marketing is all about internet marketing. It takes the help of the internet, search engines, and more to spread its words. Unlike the outbound marketing, the inbound marketing is not pushing, but pulling the audience to buy its products. The reason it is pulling is due to the perfect targeting system.</p>
<div class="call-to-action"><a href="https://bigclasses.com/digital/digital-marketing-training/">Learn More From Our Experts</a></div>
<p>Inbound marketing has a better way of targeting people. It only shows what is needed for the search engines. For example, if you are searching for watches, the search engine will only show results related to the results. While on the TV and radios, it shows unrelated advertisements. For example, if you are listening to the radio as a teen, and you hear ads related to finding a groom. Does this make sense? In inbound marketing, the targeting of products and services are advanced and absolutely perfect. It will target, according to your age, sex, occupation, marital status, and etc.</p>
<div class="blog-img">
<img src="https://bigclasses.com/digital/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inbound-marketing.jpg" alt="Inbound Marketing">
</div>
<p>And  now, talking about the cost. Inbound marketing is less expensive but more effective than the outbound marketing. Outbound marketing is costly due to the ads that need to appear on the TV, radios. And also, printing out a number of pamphlets, charts, the poster will again cost more. But in inbound marketing, the cost is less and affordable. You only need the internet and some tools to create a strategy to attract people. All you need is to create blogs and social media platforms with the help of keywords. This will attract the strangers. And then you need to create a call to action, landing pages, and forums to make these strangers into visitors. And now, as you have got visitors, you need to create emails, events, ads to make them your customer. And finally, you need to create social media posts, event posts, and some smart content to turn them into promoters. And this will not cost much, but your patience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Affiliate marketing is the kind of marketing where a company will partner with another company to sell its product, and if the product is sold, the company to whom the product belonged will give the partnered company some commission.<br />
For example, let’s say Company A is the cosmetic company. It has over 50 products. And it has partnered with Company B to sell its products. So, if the Company B sells the products, it will get some commission. The best example of this is the Amazon Associate itself. It comes under Company B. Amazon has successfully partnered with many top companies such as the Football Snack Helmets, Kids Tablets with Wifi, and more. So, when Amazon sells their products, they get a commission.</p>

</div>
<p>How do the companies track down the traffic and sales made by the companies such as Company B? Well, they do so is by adding a unique URL, and helps in tracking all the sales made. If you want to be a part of the affiliate marketing, all you need is to select a company that is selling their products. You can sign up at their company for affiliate marketing, and get a URL. You can write ample no. of blogs on their products, and keep this URL there that will recommend them to visit the company’s site. As they go to the company site, and purchase it, the company will pay the commission to you. Let’ see why a company should opt for affiliate marketing? What are their benefits?</p>
